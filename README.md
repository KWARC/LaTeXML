[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/KWARC/LaTeXML.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/KWARC/LaTeXML)

The **KWARC fork** of [LaTeXML](https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML) is a superset of the LaTeXML master, adding experimental features related to document semantization, mostly driven by the [sTeX](https://github.com/KWARC/sTeX) authoring model. It is our goal at KWARC to move towards consolidating this fork with the LaTeXML master, refactoring all special features as specialized LaTeXML plugins. The [latexmls](https://github.com/dginev/LaTeXML-Plugin-latexmls) and [ltxmojo](https://github.com/dginev/LaTeXML-Plugin-ltxmojo) are two examples of plug-ins which were originally part of this fork.
